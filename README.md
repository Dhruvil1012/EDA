Data Description Script

This project provides a Python class called info_data that allows users to load and display descriptive statistics for a dataset. The script is designed to work with CSV files and utilizes the popular pandas and numpy libraries.

Features

Data Loading: Load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Descriptive Statistics: Generate key summary statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and more, from the dataset.
Preview Data: Print the first five rows of the dataset for quick inspection.
Requirements

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
How to Use

Clone the repository or download the script.
Save your dataset (in CSV format) in the same directory.
Modify the script to point to your dataset file.
Run the script.
Example
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class info_data:
    def __init__(self, df):
        self.df = df
        
    def describe_data(self):
        print(self.df.head())        # Prints the first 5 rows of the dataset
        print(self.df.describe())    # Prints the descriptive statistics of the dataset

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('FIFA-21 Complete.csv')

# Create instance of info_data class
data_info = info_data(df)

# Display data description
data_info.describe_data()
Make sure the dataset FIFA-21 Complete.csv is present in the same directory as your script.

Dataset

This project is designed to work with datasets in CSV format. In this example, it uses the FIFA-21 Complete.csv dataset.

Running the Project

Place your dataset (CSV file) in the working directory.
Run the script in your Python environment (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc.).
The first five rows and descriptive statistics of your dataset will be printed.
